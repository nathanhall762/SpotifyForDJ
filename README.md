This is a Spotify API response in JSON format. It contains information about tracks saved by a user and includes an HTTP link (href) to the next set of results, as well as an array of up to 20 items containing information about the saved tracks, including the date they were added and information about the track and album.

Each item in the items array contains an object with two properties: added_at and track. added_at is a string containing the date and time the track was saved by the user, formatted in ISO 8601. track is an object containing information about the track, including its album, artists, and name, as well as an id and a uri that can be used to retrieve additional information about the track via the Spotify API.

The album property is an object containing information about the album that the track appears on, including its id, name, release_date, and images, which provide URLs for album artwork in various sizes.

The artists property is an array containing objects with information about the artist(s) that performed the track, including their id, name, and a link to their page on the Spotify web player (external_urls).

The available_markets property lists the countries where the track is available for streaming, and the type property indicates that this is a "track" object.
